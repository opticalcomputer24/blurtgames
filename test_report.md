# Blurt Quest Application Test Report

## Summary
I've tested the Blurt Quest puzzle game application and identified several issues that need to be addressed. The primary issue is with the Blurt authentication, which is failing because the provided account does not exist on the Blurt blockchain.

## Test Results

### Backend API Tests

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| GET /api/ | ✅ Success | Health check endpoint returns correct response |
| POST /api/auth/login | ❌ Failed | Authentication fails with 401 Unauthorized |
| GET /api/user/profile | ❌ Not Tested | Requires successful authentication |
| GET /api/game/level/1 | ❌ Not Tested | Requires successful authentication |
| GET /api/game/leaderboard | ❌ Not Tested | Requires successful authentication |

### Frontend Tests

| Feature | Status | Notes |

### Integration Tests

| Feature | Status | Notes |

### Game Logic Tests

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Level Start | ❌ Not Tested | Requires successful authentication |
| Answering Questions | ❌ Not Tested | Requires successful authentication |
| Scoring Logic | ❌ Not Tested | Requires successful authentication |
| Reward Tracking | ❌ Not Tested | Requires successful authentication |

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues

1. **Blurt Authentication Failure**
   - The account "ahp07" does not exist on the Blurt blockchain
   - The provided posting key cannot be verified
   - This prevents all further testing of the application

### Verification Steps

I created a test script to directly verify the Blurt credentials using the beem library:

```python
from beem import Blurt
from beem.account import Account
from beem.exceptions import AccountDoesNotExistsException

# Test credentials
username = "ahp07"
posting_key = "5K9Uc6kkb6gLCwhwyNeu4k7xX539Sg3A4TRebgr2MLtBFucfqFd"

# Connect to Blurt blockchain
blurt_instance = Blurt()

# Check if account exists
try:
    account = Account(username, blockchain_instance=blurt_instance)
    print(f"Account found: {account.name}")
except AccountDoesNotExistsException:
    print(f"Account '{username}' does not exist on Blurt blockchain")
```

This test confirmed that the account does not exist on the Blurt blockchain.

## Code Review

### Backend Implementation

- The backend is correctly implemented to use the Blurt blockchain for authentication
- The quiz questions are properly initialized (30 questions across 10 levels)
- The game logic for level progression, scoring, and rewards is well-designed
- The API endpoints are properly structured with the required /api prefix

### Frontend Implementation

- The frontend correctly uses the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL environment variable
- The UI is well-designed with responsive layouts
- The game dashboard and level progression are properly implemented
- The JWT token handling is correctly implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Authentication**:
   - Provide valid Blurt credentials for testing
   - OR implement a test mode that bypasses Blurt authentication for development/testing

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Once authentication is fixed, complete the testing of all game features
   - Test the full user journey from login to level completion
   - Verify reward tracking and leaderboard functionality

3. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Add better error handling for Blurt authentication failures
   - Implement a fallback authentication method for testing
   - Add more detailed logging for authentication issues

## Conclusion

The Blurt Quest application appears to be well-implemented, but testing is blocked by the authentication issue. The code structure is good, and the game logic seems solid based on code review. Once the authentication issue is resolved, further testing can be conducted to verify all functionality.
